Generate your own NFTs

non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are being resold for 5x their original price. NFTs are the basis for the emerging “digital collectible” market. Each NFT is a unique “thing” that can’t necessarily be exchanged 1:1 with another unit. 

There are two ways to make money with them: minting and trading.

As always, DYOR.

I made this program purely for a bit of fun and maybe some noteriety, as far as I know nothing else like this exists. 

Run it with Python3 and pick a Elon Tweet of your own or any other tweet or website you want to make an NFT from. 

Enjoy!
